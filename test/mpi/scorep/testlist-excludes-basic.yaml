# Exclude tests which are not supported by Score-P or trigger known issues

# Tests matching at least one of the criteria in one of the categories below
# will be excluded from the filtered testlist. For each category, a list of
# regex patterns (python syntax) can be supplied as exclude criteria.

# Match the path of the test executable relative to the top test directory against these patterns:
exe-name:
    # Tests in ./errors can be incorrect MPI programs.
    # In some cases this results in critical errors in Score-P (e.g. invalid memory)
